b. With reference to the Khan Academy’s instructional content on Algorithms (Binary Search), answer the following questions:

i. What is mathematical function that means the same thing as the number of times we repeatedly halve, starting at n, until we get the value 1? 
For example, we need to repeatedly halve 32 for 5 times until we get the value 1: 32 ➔ 16 ➔ 8 ➔ 4 ➔ 2 ➔ 1.
========
Ans: Log(n)
========

ii. The __logarithm__ function grows very slowly. _Logarithms__ are the inverse of _exponential__ function, which grows very rapidly.

iii. Complete the following pseudocode for the Binary Search:

1. Let min = 0 and max = n-1. 

2. If _min is greater than max_, then stop: target is not present in array. Return -1. 

3. Compute guess as the __average__ of max and min, rounded down (so that it is an integer). 

4. If array[guess] equals target, then stop. You found it! Return guess. 

5. If the guess was too low, that is, array[guess] < target, then set min = __guess + 1__. 

6. Otherwise, the guess was too high. Set max = _guess - 1__. 

7. Go back to step 2
