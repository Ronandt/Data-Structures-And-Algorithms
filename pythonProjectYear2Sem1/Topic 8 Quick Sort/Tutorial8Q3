List one similarity and one difference between Merge Sort and Quick Sort.


Similarities:

- Both quick sort and merge sort are divide and conquer sorting algorithms
- Both are sorting algorithms based on recursion

Differences:
- Merge sort is more efficient and works faster than quick sort in case of larger array size or datasets.
- Merge sort is a stable algorithm where as the standard Quick sort implementation is not
- Quick Sort is a in place algorithm, whereas the standard merge sort implementation is not
- Quick Sort partition the list in any ratio, depending on the pivot value. Merge Sort partition the list in any ratio,
  depending on the pivot value. Merge Sort Partition the list into 2 halves, i.e. n / 2
