A stable sorting algorithm maintains the relative order of records with equal keys.
That is, a sorting algorithm is stable if whenever there are two records R and S with the same key and with R
appearing before S in the original list, R will appear before S in the sorted list.


Are the sorting algorithms we have discussed so far
i.e. bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort and quick sort stable algorithm?

Solution:

Stable Sort:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort

Unstable Sort:
- Selection
- Quick Sort
