Python’s compact array stores a group of related variables (of the same type and size)
one after another in a contiguous portion of the computer’s memory.



For example, the above represent an array of six characters that occupies 12 bytes of memory (2 bytes for each character),
starting from memory address 2146 to 2157. Each location within the array is a cell and we use an integer index to describe
its location within the array (e.g. the cell of the above array with index 4 has content L and is stored in bytes 2154 and 2155).
Given the memory address at which an array starts, the number of bytes per element, and a desired index within the array.
Suggest a formula that can be used to compute the memory address of a specific cell in the array.

Solution:

Formula: start + cell-size * index

E.g to find the memory address for cell 4 of the above array
2146 + 2 * 4 = 2154
