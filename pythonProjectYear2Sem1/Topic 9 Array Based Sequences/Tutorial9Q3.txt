At the lowest level, what is stored in the array is a consecutive sequence of memory
addresses at which the elements of the sequence reside.
Although the relative size of the individual elements may vary,
the number of bits to store the memory address of each element is fixed (e.g. 64-bits per memory address).
The diagram below represents a Python list â€“ primes that is declared with the following statement:
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]

Modify the diagram to reflect the changes (e.g. new lists / objects / references?)
after each of the following statements is performed:
a) temp = primes[3:6]
b) temp[2] = 15
Similarly, with the help of a diagram, describe the changes (e.g. new lists / objects / references?)
after each of the following statements is performed:
c) counters = [0] * 8
d) counters[2] += 1


Solution

a) temp = primes[3:6]

b) temp[2] = 15
