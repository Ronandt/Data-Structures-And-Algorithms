b. With reference to the Khan Academy’s instructional content on Algorithms (Intro to
Algorithms), answer the following questions:


i. What algorithm is used by computer scientists to write checkers programs
that never lose?
Minmax algorithm, and alpha-beta pruning

ii. Which data structure is used in the implementation of that algorithm?
Tree data structure 

iii. What are the 2 important criteria that a good algorithm should have?
Correctness and efficiency

iv. What technique is used by computer scientists to compare the efficiency of
algorithms independent of the programming language or hardware used.
Big O/Theta/Omega Notation (Runtime analysis & Asymptomatic notations). It is scaled based on input. 

v. In the “Guessing game” activity, what are the 2 approaches (for guessing the
number) demonstrated?
Linear search, binary search 

vi. In the “Guessing game” activity (and using the more efficient approach),
guessing a number from 1 to 300 should not need more than 9 guesses. Why
is that so?
The numbers are sorted. Hence, you can use binary search. Binary search is log(n) which means that the number of operations does not scale much based on the number of inputs

vii. In the “Route-finding” activity, what is the algorithm used to find shortest path
from Start to Goal in the maze?
Square making algorithm
