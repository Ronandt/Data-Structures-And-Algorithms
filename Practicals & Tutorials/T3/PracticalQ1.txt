1) Khan Academy - Algorithms (Binary Search)
Background: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized
learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the
classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and
more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art,
adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with
institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and
MIT to offer specialized content.
Khan Academy has partnered with Dartmouth college professors Tom Cormen and Devin
Balkcom to teach introductory computer science algorithms, including searching, sorting,
recursion, and graph theory. Learn with a combination of articles, visualizations, quizzes, and
coding challenges.

a. Visit the following website (https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-
science/algorithms#binary-search) to access Khan Academy’s online instructional
content on Algorithms (Binary Search). Go through the following instructional
activities from the website:
• Binary Search
• Implementing binary search of an array
• Challenge: Binary search
• Running time of binary search


b. With reference to the Khan Academy’s instructional content on Algorithms (Binary
Search), answer the following questions:

i. What is mathematical function that means the same thing as the number of
times we repeatedly halve, starting at n, until we get the value 1? For
example, we need to repeatedly halve 32 for 5 times until we get the value
1: 32 ➔ 16 ➔ 8 ➔ 4 ➔ 2 ➔ 1.
=====================================================================
log(n)
=====================================================================



ii. The ___________ function grows very slowly. ___________ are the inverse
of ___________ function, which grows very rapidly.
=====================================================================
The log(n) (Logarithmic) function grows very slowly. N^2 (Exponential functions) are the inverse
of log(n) (Logarithmic) function, which grows very rapidly.
=====================================================================



iii. Complete the following pseudocode for the Binary Search:
1. Let min = 0 and max = n-1.
2. If ___min___ is greater than ___max___, then stop: target is not present in array. Return -1.
3. Compute guess as the ____middle____ of max and min, rounded down (so
that it is an integer).
4. If array[guess] equals target, then stop. You found it! Return
guess.
5. If the guess was too low, that is, array[guess] < target, then
set min = ____guess+1____.
6. Otherwise, the guess was too high. Set max = ____guess-1____.
7. Go back to step 2
